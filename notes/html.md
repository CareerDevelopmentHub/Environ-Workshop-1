# 🔥 HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

Html is the basic structure of a web page, it is a document file which is rendered by the browers

**🚨 Note: It is not a programming language**

It is a markup language which uses different type of tags to create the layout structure of a web page.

## Types of Html Tags

- elements with closing tags such as `<div>Hi</div>`
- elements with self closing tags such as `<input />`

## Types of Html Elements

- Block Elemets: These are the elements which covers the entire width i.e `<div>Inline Element</div>`
- Inline Elements: These are the elements which covers only the width required by the element i.e. `<span>Inline Element</span>`

## Attributes & Values

HTML attributes are additional pieces of information that can be added to HTML elements to change their appearance or behavior. Attributes are specified in the start tag of an element, and are made up of a name and a value. For example, the following <img> element has two attributes: src and alt.

```
<img src="my-image.png" alt="My image">
```
