# 🔥 What is we development?

Web development is the building and maintenance of websites. It encompasses all the activities involved in creating a website, from designing its appearance to writing the code that makes it work. Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development.

Front-end development is the part of web development that users see and interact with. It includes the design, layout, and user interface of a website. Front-end developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual elements of a website and to make them interactive.

Back-end development is the part of web development that users don't see. It includes the server-side code, databases, and other infrastructure that powers a website. Back-end developers use programming languages such as Python, Java, and PHP to write the code that handles tasks such as processing user input, storing and retrieving data, and generating dynamic content.
